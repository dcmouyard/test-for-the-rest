Test for the Rest
=================

Most organizations are aware of how important it is to make their websites accessible to visitors with disabilities. But ask yourself: when was the last time your organization actually tested your site for accessibility? And do you know how to do it? In this session we’ll dive into the tests you should take to find out how your site stacks up, how to discover what you’re missing, and what steps you can follow to fix your site to ensure that you’re serving your whole audience, by meeting the needs of your disabled visitors.

Takeaways:
* How to gather enough data to prioritize and fix problems on your site
* What the four types of testing are
* When it makes sense to test for accessibility
* Where to find good evaluation tools
